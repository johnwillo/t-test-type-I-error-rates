# Test of type I error rates from the independent-sample t test through simulation
This paper examines, through simulations, how well the independent-sample t test approximates the desired Type I error specified in the test. The results for equal and unequal sample sizes and equal and unequal variances are examined, both for normal and skewed distributions.
